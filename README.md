# Abm
This is code which uses an agent-based model. 
The code builds a series of agents in space.
Each agent will have a list of the other agents so they can communicate.
Each agent will know about the environment it is in and be able to query/change the environment.
Agents will move around the environment eating it, but checking first that other agents aren't already in the neighbourhood.
The environment will contain data from a file.
We'll display the environment and other data after the model has run.
We'll be able to save the environment as results of the model.
